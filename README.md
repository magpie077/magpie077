### 🌱 About Me

I’m a practicing monk at ISKCON, and I balance my spiritual life with my passion for technology.  
I lead projects that bridge devotion and digital innovation — from **donation management systems** and **kitchen order apps** to **gift reciprocation workflows**, **payment gateway integrations**, and **hierarchical reporting tools** in **ERPNext**, **FastAPI**, **Angular**, and **Flutter**.

I believe technology should simplify service — not complicate it.  
My mornings and afternoons are dedicated to spiritual practice, and my evenings to creation, coding, and contribution (mostly).

### ⚙️ Philosophy

> "_Technology in service of devotion is devotion itself._"

Every script, schema, or system I write is meant to make seva smoother, clearer, and more connected.  
I see open source as a digital yajna — a collective offering of intelligence.

### 🛠️ My Development Principles

- Build for **clarity**, not complexity  
- Automate repetitive tasks  
- Keep humans in the loop  
- Write code you’d be happy to maintain six months later
